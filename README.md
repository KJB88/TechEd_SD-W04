<h2>Project Outline</h2>
<p>Develop a front-end page for a Guest Book and a persistent back-end to handle POST requests and populate the website with user content. The front-end must be usable on different devices (mobile responsive) and have implementation to handle common accessibility concerns.</p>
  <p><b>All requirements and stretch goals are being worked on.</b></p>

  <h2>User Stories</h2>
  <h3>As a User...</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I want to visit the website and read information on my phone or computer.</li>
    <li>I want to be able to leave a message in the guestbook.</li>
    <li>I want to be able to see the messages that have been left in the guestbook.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>'90s Kid</b>: Have a mobile-responsive, accessible and functional website for users to view messages in the Guest Book.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Get a shiny form on the go so the user can share their 'interesting' stories about that thing no one cares about.</li>
    <li>Get that page showing all those messages! (Yes, even the messages from Tim.)</li>
    <li>Style it so that users can enjoy the flame wars from their handheld and/or desktop (mmm, multi-tasking).</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
<li><b>Trolling the Forums</b>: Allow users to leave a message in the Guest Book for others to read.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>API POST route those definitely not-mean comments from the input form.</li>
    <li>Setup and whack that data into a database. <em>*laughs maniacally in SQL*</em></li>
    <li>API GET route all those lovely, completely civil and polite messages from the DB.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Stretch Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Damage Control</b>: Give the user the option to <b>delete</b> a message, preferably their own!</li>
<li><b>Dopamine Hit</b>: Allow the user to <b>like</b> a message, which will increment a <b>like counter</b> on the message.</li>
</ul>
